Developed a comprehensive data pipeline for weather pattern analysis using Python and Big Data technologies. Leveraged datasets containing temperature, humidity, and wind speed to investigate climate trends and anomalies. Implemented data ingestion and performed real-time data processing using PySpark for scalable transformation and aggregation. Developed advanced visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate temporal changes in weather conditions. Emphasized data quality checks and missing value treatments to enhance reliability. Collaborated in a cloud-based Jupyter environment to support interactive data exploration and reproducibility.
