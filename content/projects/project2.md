Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Iris dataset using statistical and machine learning techniques to classify iris species based on petal and sepal measurements. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset, followed by the implementation of classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVMs). Leveraged Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model training. Achieved high accuracy in species classification and contributed to a deeper understanding of feature importance in botanical datasets.
