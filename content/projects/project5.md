Conducted an end-to-end data analysis and customer segmentation project using mall customer demographic and spending data. Employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including statistical summaries and visualizations, to uncover patterns in customer age, income, and spending behavior. Implemented clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing habits. Elbow method and dendrograms were utilized for optimal cluster determination. The insights derived helped in identifying key customer profiles, enabling targeted marketing strategies. This project emphasized data-driven decision-making in a retail context and highlighted the importance of unsupervised learning in business analytics
