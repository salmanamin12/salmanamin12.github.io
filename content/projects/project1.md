Developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze and classify physical activity types based on accelerometer sensor data. Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including missing value treatment, encoding, and standardization to ensure model robustness. Applied supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Decision Trees to predict exercise categories, leveraging time-domain and frequency-domain features. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Emphasized explainability by interpreting feature importance and patterns across different activity levels. This project demonstrated the practical application of data-driven insights in the field of wearable fitness monitoring and human activity recognition
