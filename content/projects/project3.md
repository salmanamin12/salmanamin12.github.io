Developed a neural network-based model to classify diabetes using the Pima Indian dataset and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. The project emphasized structured preprocessing, including normalization and train-test splitting, to prepare the data for deep learning. Constructed and trained an MLP model using TensorFlow, leveraging dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. Hyperparameter tuning, such as batch size and epoch adjustments, contributed to model optimization. This project demonstrated the application of deep learning techniques in medical diagnostics, contributing to enhanced prediction of diabetes onset from clinical indicators.
